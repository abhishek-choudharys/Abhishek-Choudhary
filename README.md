My personal portfolio page, containing information about me, how to contact me and updates about my projects.
A highly customised style to suite my own taste and reflect my personality in a certain way, for originality is something that never fails to amaze!

To create this project I employed use of HTML and CSS, mostly, with a little JS in tow, for the details. But, for most of the designing, I employed CSS. The project is highly and easily customisable. Any reviews and crtiticism are welcome!
